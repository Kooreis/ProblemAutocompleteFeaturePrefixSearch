# Question: How do you implement an autocomplete feature using a prefix search? C# Summary

The provided C# code implements an autocomplete feature using a prefix search. It uses a data structure known as a Trie, which is a tree-like structure where each path from the root to a leaf node represents a word. The words are stored in the Trie by breaking them down into individual characters, each of which is used as a key in a dictionary. The value associated with each key is another TrieNode, which contains its own dictionary of children. This forms the tree-like structure of the Trie. When a prefix is searched, the program traverses the Trie using the characters in the prefix. If it encounters a node that does not have a child for the next character in the prefix, it returns an empty list, indicating that there are no words with that prefix. However, if it successfully traverses all the characters in the prefix, it returns the list of words at the final node, providing the autocomplete suggestions.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a similar approach to the C# version. Both use a Trie data structure to store words and perform prefix searches. The Trie is implemented as a tree of nodes, where each node represents a character and has a dictionary of child nodes. 

However, there are some differences in the implementation details:

1. In the Python version, each node has an `end_of_word` attribute to indicate whether it represents the end of a word. In the C# version, each node has a `Words` list to store the words that end at that node.

2. The Python version uses a helper function `_get_words_from_node` to collect all words that start with a given prefix. This function is called recursively on all child nodes. In the C# version, the words are stored directly in the nodes, so there's no need for a similar function.

3. The Python version uses the `extend` method to add multiple elements to a list, while the C# version uses the `Add` method to add a single element to a list.

4. The Python version uses the `input` function to read user input, while the C# version uses `Console.ReadLine`.

5. The Python version uses a `while True` loop and breaks when the user types "exit". The C# version uses a `while (true)` loop and doesn't provide a way to exit.

6. The Python version uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` idiom to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.

7. The Python version uses the `items` method to iterate over a dictionary, while the C# version uses the `ContainsKey` method to check if a key exists in a dictionary. 

8. The Python version uses the `not in` operator to check if a key doesn't exist in a dictionary, while the C# version uses the `!` operator to negate the result of `ContainsKey`.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution is similar to the C# version in that they both use a Trie data structure to store the words and perform prefix searches. However, there are a few differences in the implementation and language features used.

1. In the Java version, the TrieNode class has an additional boolean field `endOfWord` to indicate if the node represents the end of a word. This is used in the `findAllWords` method to add the word to the result list when it encounters a node that is the end of a word. In the C# version, each node stores a list of words that end at that node.

2. The Java version uses a `StringBuilder` to build the words as it traverses the Trie in the `findAllWords` method. This is more efficient than concatenating strings in Java. The C# version does not need to do this because it stores the words directly in the nodes.

3. The Java version has an `input` method that takes a character, updates the current prefix, and returns the list of words that start with the current prefix. If the input character is '#', it inserts the current prefix into the Trie and resets the prefix. The C# version does not have this feature. Instead, it reads a prefix from the console and searches for words that start with that prefix in a loop.

4. The Java version uses the `HashMap` and `ArrayList` classes from the Java Collections Framework for storing the children of each node and the result list of words. The C# version uses the `Dictionary` and `List` classes from the System.Collections.Generic namespace for the same purpose.

5. The Java version uses a for-each loop (`for (char c : s.toCharArray())`) to iterate over the characters in a string. The C# version uses a similar foreach loop (`foreach (var ch in word)`), but does not need to convert the string to a character array first.

6. The Java version uses the `System.out.println` method to print the results to the console. The C# version uses the `Console.WriteLine` method for the same purpose.
